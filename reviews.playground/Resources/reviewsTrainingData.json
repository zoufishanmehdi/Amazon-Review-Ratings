  "text": "In the past 3 years, I have bought 4 styles of Asics running shoes and these are my favorite!\nMy sell points for determining that these are \"good\" sneakers:\n1.) Toe Space - I have problems with my toes going numb if I don't have adequate room in the toe box. To accommodate, I usually order a size 10 and lace up tightly (when I wear a 9 or 9.5) in regular shoes. This causes my shoes to typically wear faster in the heels because they side around a little, but my toes don't go numb after my daily 4 mile trail hike.\n2.) Comfort - This includes arch support and overall cushioning. I have bad knees, so I can tell when the cushioning starts to go in sneakers. Mine last almost 3 months exactly when worn for 4 miles daily.\n3.) Cuteness - Sorry to be vain but I want sneakers to be cute and have pink on them. These are the only kind I buy. Judge me if you must ;)\n4.) Easy to put on / take off - I hate untying my shoes, so I love that these have a loop in the back so I can slip them on with minimal unlacing (lazy).\n5.) Doesn't cake-in dirt/mud - When on loose dirt trails, I often encounter dirt & mud that gets caked into my soles, so I favor the Asics styles over, say K-Swiss because the soles don't have a lot of \"hiding places\" for mud to get packed into.\nI compared:\nASICS Women's Gel-Venture 5 - My all time favorite for toe space as well as cushion and arch support and wears well.\nASICS Women's Gel-contend 3 - Wider in the arch area but narrow in the toes and heels.\nASICS Women's Gel-scram 2 - Great toe space but not much arch support to speak of (super-cute though!)\nASICS Women's Gel Frequency 2 - Actually a walking shoe and built much less \"tough\" and more lightweight but has a flimsy feel to it and comes up short against the back of the heel, so it fit kinda weird.\nWhen I say these shoes \"wear well\" I mean that they don't look like they are falling apart even after much use/wear. The only indicators of wear that they show are some wear on the inside of the heels but probably only because I wear a half size too big on purpose, and also some fraying where the inner fabric (pink) meets the lace holes. (See pics)\nOverall, I love these shoes the best of all I've tried in Asics as well as Adidas, Saucony, Vibram and K-Swiss and won't be straying from the Gel-Venture 5 shoes again. I love them and don't think it gets any better than this :)",

I used to buy Ryka but it has a new owner for years now and even though it is still good, just as good as ASICS, it only lasts about 3 months for someone that rarely uses a tennis shoes and it cost me $80.00. So, just a little feedback on this one. The shoes is just as comfortable as Ryka, which says a lot. It is perfect, now for durability, I don't know how long it will last yet, but the comfort and support are excellent.",

I have never had a pair of shoes with mesh where my pinky toes don't start poking through after a few months of wear. I've been wearing these since May 2017 and the mesh is still fully intact, and I notice that my knees don't hurt as much or at all depending on the day and the weather.

I have somewhat wide feet at the front with narrow heels, and the heels were slipping when I first put them on. That was easily remedied by lacing through the optional 7th eyelet towards the back. This made the laces pretty short, and I originally had planned to buy longer laces, but they grew on me - they take a little more dexterity to tie now, but I don't have laces flopping around, and they stay tied really well even without my usual double knot. Other than the easy-to-fix heel slippage issue, comfy straight out of the box, good for running, walking, general workouts. Plus they look snazzy. :)",

The snugness in the width area completely vanished after they were broken in, but getting a half size larger was a smart choice.

I have a 16 yr old injury (L ankle, all ligaments torn) and a 2 yr old injury (R foot - shattered metatarsal with plate and 6 screws). I have scoliosis and I'm 12 yrs post T4-L5 spinal fusion ... my body has been telling me to stop exercising and I refuse! With all these injuries comes weakness and re-injury and a lot of jarring when running. These shoes have excellent shock absorption - I don't have residual lumbar pain, knee pain or ankle pain from pounding the pavement, nor to I have residual pain in my broken foot. There is room for me to wear an ankle brace (flexible brace, not a bulky one but it's still a solid brace). I love the little pull handle at the heel for extra traction pulling the shoe on with that brace creating a snug fit. I have very narrow feet with high arches and I still get excellent overall support from these shoes. I'm a 9.5 medium consistently across all shoe types. I noticed many people saying they found these shoes short and would go half a size up - I didn't do that and I have a perfect fit at 9.5 with good room in the toe box. This could be because my feet are so narrow? Maybe wider feet find these to be too small...? Overall these are great value for money for my needs.

The other pair (as I bought 2 pair of the same shoes in different colors...one for the club, one for outdoors) I wear to do strength training, TRX, treadmill, and other club activities which is usually around 2 hours 3 or 4 times a week. So, for that amount of time, they are great. I personally do not wear tennis shoes beyond working out. I'm a sandal person or light weight loafers.

I knew my regular running shoes won't have a good traction going up/down those hills so I purchased a pair of gel venture trail shoes after extensive research on many different trail shoes from various manufacturers and this fit my bill perfectly. I am actually very happy I found Gel-Venture is highly rated yet reasonably priced among many other high-end shoes because I really like ASICS. First time I put them on, I knew they would perform well for my needs. Where the small pebbles roll under my regular running shoes and make me slip, these shoes grips the ground well and makes it easier to go up and down the hills and I feel safer. I am VERY happy with these shoes.",

Very comfortable and provides great arch support\n3. They aren't too tight around the toes or ankles\nI got the purple and silver outlined ones, the colors go great together and are vibrant enough to not be boring or overwhelming.\nThese shoes provide the right amount of arch support I need for my medium arches and my heels. The material allows for enough movement so that your feet aren't feeling stiff or experiencing limited motion in the shoe while running, walking, or cycling.\nThere's enough space for your toes to wiggle so they dont lose circulation and so far I haven't experience any rubbing od the show against the back of my heels. (I also wear altheletic socks with heel tabs so this is probably a big factor here)\nMy biggest issue with these shoes is that they provide zero support when the ground is wet. I'm constant slipping and almost falling when I wear these and walk across tile and laminate floors. In all honesty if I had know these had zero slip resistance I would've gone with a different shoe because in my current budget 50-60 dollars is a lot to spend on shoes that I'll end up hurting myself in.\nSo all in all these shoes very pretty and provide good arch and heel support. They are made with good materials but they aren't slip resistant whatsoever. If youre okay with slippery shoes that are very cute then go for it. If youre like me and want some sort of slip resistance with your running shoe I recommend doing some research on shoes with better slip resistance especially since these are on the expensive side.",

The new ones would be okay if they had more cushioning and longer shoe strings. I wear a narrow heel which means that I must use the top two eyelets to get the shoes tight enough to not slip. This usually does not pose a problem but these shoe strings are so short that I cannot tie a nurse's knot in them, in fact, can barely tie a secure bow in them.

They irritate my feet when I exercise and leave my feet on the verge of blisters. It's so bad that I can't wear them the next day. I'm not sure if maybe they run too big, but that really surprises me because my shoe size doesn't fluctuate and I have always purchased a size 10, sometimes even 10 1/2. Also, if your feet overpronate I do not recommend these at all as the support on these shoes make my overpronation worse.\n3-month update:\nThe shoes are now even worse! If there were was an option to choose 0 stars, I would lower my initial 1-star review. It's only been 3 months and the shoes are actually falling apart. I've had Asics shoes that I've worn for hours, 6 days a week, when I used to do marching band that have held up for literally years, but 3 months in and the soles are detaching. I only wear them twice a week for about 2 hours each day when I go to the gym. I'm beginning to think these are not real Asics and maybe I got a knock-off sent to me. Money down the drain :(",

It's too bad because the color was fun, and no matter how many pairs of ASIC shoes I have, I always need more. :)",
