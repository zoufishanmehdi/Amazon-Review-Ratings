# Custom Natural Language model for using Amazon reviews to predict rating

In order to create a custom model using CreateML, I collected reviews for Asics shoes for 1 star, 3 stars and 5 stars (110 each) using scrapping tool like parsehub in json format. Once the model was generated, I deployed it using Natural Language.
